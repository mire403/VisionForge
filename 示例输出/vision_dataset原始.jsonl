In the upper central part, a small building with a blue roof is visible next to a vertical road. Towards the lower-middle left, a cluster of small white buildings is situated alongside a dark, elongated body, which appears to be a pond or a specialized covered cultivation area, surrounded by some green trees and vegetation.","tags":["aerial view","agricultural landscape","farm fields","crops","dirt roads","grid pattern","rural","green vegetation","farming","cultivation","buildings","pond"],"stats":{"time_ms":5937,"model":"gemini-2.5-flash"}}
